This is what our current brand objects look like:

brands
|
L-> [brand_id]
    |
    L-> contribution
	|
	L-> democrat: [democrat total]
	L-> level: [contribution level]	
	L-> primary_party: [party most donated to]
	L-> republican: [republican total]
	L-> politician
	    |
	    L-> history: [backups of all the previous uploads]
	    L-> latest
		|
		L-> company: [amount donated from the company pac]
		L-> individuals: [amount donated by senior execs]
		L-> political_action_commitees: [amount donated to pacs]
		L-> top_politicians_and_pacs: [a list of politicans and pacs donated to]
		L-> top_politicians_only: [a list of politicans donated to]

This is what I want to restructure to:

brands
|
L-> [brand_id]
    |
    L-> records
	|
	L-> 2026
	    |
	    L-> pac [company pac donations]
		|
		L> democrat: [amount from the company pac to dems]
		L> republican: [amount from the company pac to reps]
	    L-> exec [company exec donations]
		|
		L> democrat: [amount from the company execs to dems]
		L> republican: [amount from the company execs to reps]
	L-> 2024 [same thing but different cycle]
...

We don't need contribution level, primary party or the history of previous uploads, all of this data is redundant
